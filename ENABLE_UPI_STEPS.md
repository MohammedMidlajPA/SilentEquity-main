### Step 3: Save Changes
- Click **"Save"** or **"Update"** button
- UPI will now be available in your checkout

## What If UPI Doesn't Appear?

If you don't see UPI in the list, it means:
1. **UPI is not available** for your account type/location
2. **UPI requires beta access** - Contact Stripe Support

### Contact Stripe Support
- Go to: https://support.stripe.com/contact
- Request: "I'd like to enable UPI payments for Indian customers"
- They'll help you enable it if your account qualifies

## Alternative: Check Payment Method Availability

2. Search for "UPI" in the search bar
3. If it appears, click to enable it

## After Enabling UPI

Once UPI is enabled:
1. ✅ Your checkout will automatically show UPI option
2. ✅ Indian customers can pay with UPI
3. ✅ No code changes needed - it's already configured!

## Test It

After enabling:
1. Create a checkout session (click "JOIN THE WAITLIST")
2. Open the Stripe Checkout page
3. You should see **"UPI"** as a payment option
4. Test with a UPI ID or QR code
